# Advanced File Compressor - TODOs and Enhancement Plan

## Core Functionality Enhancements

### Phase 1: Additional Formats Support
- [ ] Implement TAR format support
- [ ] Implement GZ format support
- [ ] Implement BZ2 format support
- [ ] Implement XZ format support
- [ ] Research and implement 7z format support (might require CGO or external libraries)

### Phase 2: Advanced Compression Features
- [ ] Implement AES-256 encryption for ZIP archives
- [ ] Add support for archive splitting into multiple volumes
- [ ] Implement selective extraction (extract specific files/directories)
- [ ] Add overwrite handling options (Skip, Rename, Overwrite)
- [ ] Implement compression level selection (Fastest, Normal, Maximum)

### Phase 3: Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement multi-threading for faster compression/extraction
- [ ] Add parallel file processing
- [ ] Optimize memory usage for large files
- [ ] Add buffer size configuration options

## User Interface Improvements

### Phase 1: CLI Improvements
- [ ] Enhance CLI with more options and better help documentation
- [ ] Implement command-line flags with proper parsing (using flags or cobra package)
- [ ] Add verbose output mode
- [ ] Implement quiet mode for scripting

### Phase 2: GUI Development
- [ ] Research cross-platform GUI options (Fyne, Qt, etc.)
- [ ] Design basic GUI layout
- [ ] Implement file/directory browsing
- [ ] Add drag-and-drop support
- [ ] Create archive viewing/browsing interface
- [ ] Implement progress visualization

## Advanced Features

### Phase 2: Integration and Advanced Processing
- [ ] Implement cloud storage integration (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.)
- [ ] Add incremental and differential archiving
- [ ] Implement batch processing of multiple archives
- [ ] Create archive health check and repair functionality
- [ ] Add secure deletion option

### Phase 3: Monitoring and Automation
- [ ] Implement watched folder functionality
